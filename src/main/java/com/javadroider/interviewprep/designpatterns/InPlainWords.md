# Creational (FABS P)

Prototype pattern creates object based on an existing object through cloning.

Singleton ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created.

# Structural (DAFF CP)

Decorator pattern lets you dynamically change the behavior of an object at run time by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class.

Adapter pattern, as the name implies, adapts one interface to another. It acts as a bridge between two unrelated, and sometimes even completely incompatible interfaces

Facade pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

Flyweight is used to minimize memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with similar objects.

Composite pattern lets clients treat the individual objects in a uniform manner.

Using the proxy pattern, a class represents the functionality of another class.

# Behavioral (COSMIST CV)

COR helps building a chain of objects. Request enters from one end and keeps going from object to object till it finds the suitable handler.

Observer pattern defines a dependency between objects so that whenever an object changes its state, all its dependents are notified.

Strategy pattern allows you to switch the algorithm or strategy based upon the situation.

Mediator pattern adds a third party object (called mediator) to control the interaction between two objects (called colleagues). It helps reduce the coupling between the classes communicating with each other. Because now they don't need to have the knowledge of each other's implementation.

Iterator pattern presents a way to access the elements of an object without exposing the underlying presentation.

State pattern lets you change the behavior of a class when the state changes.

Template method defines the skeleton of how a certain algorithm could be performed, but defers the implementation of those steps to the children classes.

Command pattern allows you to encapsulate actions in objects. The key idea behind this pattern is to provide the means to decouple client from receiver.

Visitor pattern lets you add further operations to objects without having to modify them.
